METHODOLOGY NOTE: PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS LIMITATION

Initial analysis revealed fundamental limitations for predictive modeling:
- Near-zero correlations between historical behavior and future spending
- All feature-future outcome correlations < 0.06
- Customer future behavior is unpredictable with available RFM features

SUCCESSFUL ANALYTICAL PIVOT:
The project successfully delivered value through descriptive analytics:
- RFM segmentation with clear strategic implications
- Actionable customer prioritization based on historical value
- Data-driven marketing recommendations
- Product category performance insights

All deliverables are based on proven historical patterns rather than unreliable future predictions.
