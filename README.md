# Superstore Predictive Customer Analytics - Feasibility Assessment

This project explores the **feasibility of predictive modeling** for customer behavior forecasting, building on insights from [Superstore RFM Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/moneteer808-oss/Superstore-RFM-Customer-Segmentation).  
The analysis reveals fundamental data limitations and successfully **pivots to descriptive analytics** for actionable business insights.

## Key Findings
- **Predictive modeling limitations identified**: All correlations with future spend < 0.06
- **Strategic pivot to descriptive analytics**: RFM segmentation provides reliable business value
- **Actionable customer segments**: High-value at-risk customers identified for immediate action
- **Technology category superiority**: Highest spend and lowest churn rates

## Analytical Journey
1. **Predictive Modeling Exploration**: Attempted churn and CLV prediction
2. **Feasibility Assessment**: Discovered weak predictive signals in the data
3. **Strategic Pivot**: Successfully delivered value through descriptive segmentation
4. **Business Insights**: Customer prioritization and marketing recommendations

## Outputs
- `customer_analytics_comprehensive.csv`: Complete customer intelligence dataset
- `high_priority_customers.csv`: Immediate action required customer list
- `marketing_strategy_recommendations.csv`: Data-driven action plan
- `methodology_notes.txt`: Detailed feasibility assessment documentation

## Visual Highlights  
Key insights from the descriptive analytics approach:

### Key Learning
This project demonstrates mature analytical judgment: knowing when **not** to use advanced models is as important as knowing when to use them.
